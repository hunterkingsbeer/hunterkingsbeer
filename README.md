### Hello, I'm Hunter! Nice to meet you :)
Lately, my focus has been on my software engineering project Receipted! It was recently released on the app store, which is a huge achievement for me and my team. https://apps.apple.com/nz/app/receipted/id1589713322

Starting this summer, I am joining the Education Perfect team in Dunedin as a software engineer. I feel incredibly priviledged to have the opportunity to join EP, and am excited to see what I can achieve working with the team!
