### Hello! 

I'm a final year undergrad student at the University of Otago, studying Computer Science and Microbiology/Immunology. 📚

Check out my repos to see some of my experience with different languages, skills and concepts. 🌳

I've been working a lot with Swift lately, primarily on the app [Receipted](https://github.com/hunterkingsbeer/345-Project). 
My team's incredible work is set for a full release on October 4th! I'd love if you checked it out. 📸
