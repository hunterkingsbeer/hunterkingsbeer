### Hello, I'm Hunter!


I'm currently a software engineer in the Lexicon team at Education Perfect. 

Fullstack - focusing on backend. Working primarily with F#/.NET to make micro-services surrounding our content! I have a big interest in app development, specifically using Swift and SwiftUI.

- My app [Receipted](https://apps.apple.com/nz/app/receipted/id1589713322) is on the app store!
