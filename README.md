### Hello!

I'm a student at the University of Otago, studying Computer Science and Microbiology/Immunology.

I've been working a lot with Swift lately, primarily on the app Receipted (345-Project). 
My team's incredible work is set for a full release on October 4th! I'd love if you checked it out.
